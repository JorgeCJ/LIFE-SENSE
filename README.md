A Full Stack project to help everyone find their purpose. You'll just need to put it in the `.env` file on the backend and configure it. To do so, you must fill in the following form: `MYSQL_DATABASE_URL="mysql://DATABASE_NAME:HOST:PORT/USERNAME:PASSWORD"`. And of course, don't forget to give these two commands in both terminals: "npm i" and "npm run dev" respectively. See it on [Vercel](https://life-sense-flame.vercel.app/).
